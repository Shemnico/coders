How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
* I first need to understand the user's needs by asking questions that will help me better understand the end goal. Creating User stories will help keep the task achievable and straightforward while maintaining functionality.\
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
* I will take the approach that I have learned in this course. I will collaborate with fellow developers. Ask questions. Set a vision of the project. I will love to incorporate the Scrum Team method. I feel that would be the most effective method of the agile process. I'm extremely new to CS and to say that do I hope to incorporate agile into my future development work is too soon to say. Of course, I would now because I have only exposed and know very little otherwise.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
* I understand what means to be a good team member. Did I achieve in this course and the projects that worked on together? I feel that I have the skill set and the right mind set to accomplish this but if we were to be honest I struggled throughout this term and I would say I was not a good team member if we were in the real world.
